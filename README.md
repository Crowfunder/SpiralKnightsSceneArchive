# SpiralKnightsSceneArchive
The Spiral Knights client only downloads scenes (levels) from the server as they are needed, and some are normally not saved to the hard drive at all. Should the servers ever shut down said content would be lost, this archive aims to fix that by preserving them.


"scenesmain.log" contains a log of when each file was downloaded, "scenesmaini18n.log" is the same but with the scene names translated to their human readable level names as seen in the game itself.


Scenes with ID's greater than 1073741823 are procedurally generated levels, scenes below are static and only changed when updated manually by the dev team.


In order to do anything useful with these you will need the Tudey Scene Editor, this is part of Clyde which can be found here: [https://github.com/threerings/clyde](https://github.com/threerings/clyde)


# Contributing
Cached scenes can be found in the "scenes" folder of any Spiral Knights install, if you have any to contribute, especially from an older install of the game, simply open a Pull Request here. Please create a new folder to keep them seperate from the main archive, your GitHub username is a suitable folder name if in doubt.


If you are not a GitHub user, or do not know how to open a Pull Request, feel free to PM me directly to contribute. The best place to reach me is Twitter: [https://twitter.com/sinkillerj](https://twitter.com/sinkillerj)
